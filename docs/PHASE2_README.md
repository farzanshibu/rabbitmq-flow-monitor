# Phase 2: Real-time Features Implementation

This phase implements real-time monitoring capabilities for the RabbitMQ Flow Monitor application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Message Flow Animations
- **Visual message tracking**: Animated dots show message flow between nodes
- **Real-time visualization**: Messages appear as they flow through the topology
- **Tooltip information**: Shows routing key and message size during animation
- **Performance optimized**: Automatic cleanup of completed animations

### 2. Live Metric Updates
- **Real-time node metrics**: Message rates, queue depths, consumer counts update live
- **Visual status indicators**: Color-coded status with pulse animations for active nodes
- **Enhanced node display**: Detailed metrics with performance indicators
- **Smooth transitions**: Animated updates with visual feedback

### 3. SSE/WebSocket Integration
- **WebSocket service**: Primary real-time communication channel
- **SSE fallback**: Server-Sent Events as backup connection method
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Connection status**: Visual indicators for connection state
- **Mock data support**: Development-friendly mock data generation

### 4. Enhanced UI Components

#### Real-time Node Components
- `EnhancedProducerNode`: Shows production rate and activity levels
- `EnhancedExchangeNode`: Displays exchange type and throughput
- `EnhancedQueueNode`: Queue depth, consumer count, and message rates
- `EnhancedConsumerNode`: Processing rate and performance indicators

#### Dashboard Components
- `MetricsDashboard`: Comprehensive real-time metrics view
- `ConnectionStatus`: Connection health and status display
- `MessageFlowAnimation`: Smooth message flow visualization

### 5. Services and Hooks

#### WebSocket Service (`src/services/rabbitmqWebSocket.ts`)
- Full-duplex communication with backend
- Message and metrics event handling
- Connection management and error handling
- Mock data generation for development

#### SSE Service (`src/services/rabbitmqSSE.ts`)
- Server-Sent Events implementation
- Unidirectional data streaming
- Automatic reconnection logic
- Development-friendly fallback

#### Real-time Hook (`src/hooks/useRealTimeData.ts`)
- Centralized state management for real-time data
- Metrics aggregation and flow tracking
- Connection state management
- Automatic cleanup of old data

## Backend Server

### Mock Backend (`server/index.js`)
- Express.js server with WebSocket and SSE endpoints
- Generates realistic mock RabbitMQ data
- Handles multiple client connections
- Health check endpoints

### Endpoints
- `ws://localhost:8080`: WebSocket connection
- `http://localhost:8080/events`: SSE endpoint
- `http://localhost:8080/health`: Health check

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev:full

# Or start separately:
npm run dev          # Frontend only
npm run server:dev   # Backend only
```

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
```bash
# Real-time Services
VITE_RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
VITE_WS_PORT=8080
VITE_SSE_PORT=8080
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Technical Implementation

### Animation System
- CSS-based animations with requestAnimationFrame
- DOM positioning for smooth message flow
- Automatic cleanup and memory management
- Performance optimized for multiple concurrent animations

### Real-time Data Flow
1. Backend generates mock RabbitMQ metrics
2. Data sent via WebSocket/SSE to frontend
3. React hooks manage state updates
4. Components re-render with new data
5. Animations triggered for visual feedback

### Connection Management
- Primary: WebSocket for bi-directional communication
- Fallback: SSE for unidirectional streaming
- Auto-reconnection with configurable retry logic
- Connection status indicators in UI

### Performance Optimizations
- Throttled updates to prevent UI flooding
- Automatic cleanup of old message flows
- Efficient React re-rendering with useMemo/useCallback
- CSS-based animations for smooth performance

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with WebSocket support
- SSE support for older browsers
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- Dark/light theme support

## Future Enhancements
- Authentication and authorization
- Real RabbitMQ Management API integration
- Historical data and trending
- Alert system and notifications
- Export capabilities for metrics
