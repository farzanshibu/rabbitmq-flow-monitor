# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RabbitMQ Service Management App is a comprehensive web application that provides real-time visualization and management capabilities for RabbitMQ message broker systems. The application will offer an interactive topology diagram showing message flows, real-time monitoring, and complete management functionality for exchanges, queues, bindings, and consumers. Built with Next.js and React Flow, it will serve as both a monitoring tool and operational interface for RabbitMQ infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to visualize the complete RabbitMQ topology in an interactive diagram, so that I can understand message flow patterns and system architecture at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display an interactive React Flow diagram showing all producers, exchanges, queues, and consumers as distinct node types
2. WHEN a user drags a node THEN the system SHALL update the node position and maintain connection relationships
3. WHEN a user right-clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with configuration options
4. WHEN the topology contains more than 50 nodes THEN the system SHALL provide zoom and pan controls for navigation
5. IF the topology is empty THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message with instructions to add components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time message flows with animations, so that I can monitor message processing and identify bottlenecks immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is published THEN the system SHALL animate the message moving from producer to exchange
2. WHEN a message is routed to a queue THEN the system SHALL animate the message moving from exchange to queue
3. WHEN a message is consumed THEN the system SHALL animate the message moving from queue to consumer
4. WHEN a message is acknowledged THEN the system SHALL display a visual confirmation indicator
5. WHEN a message is dead-lettered THEN the system SHALL animate the message to the dead-letter queue with a distinct visual style
6. IF SSE connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display a connection status indicator and attempt reconnection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want to publish test messages with custom payloads and routing keys, so that I can test message routing and system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the message publishing interface THEN the system SHALL provide form fields for exchange selection, routing key, headers, and payload
2. WHEN I submit a message THEN the system SHALL publish the message to the specified exchange and display confirmation
3. WHEN I save a message template THEN the system SHALL store the template for future reuse
4. WHEN I load a saved template THEN the system SHALL populate the form with the template data
5. IF the message publishing fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create and manage exchanges, queues, and bindings through the web interface, so that I can configure the message broker without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new exchange THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify type (direct, fanout, topic, headers), durability, and auto-delete properties
2. WHEN I create a new queue THEN the system SHALL allow me to configure TTL, max-length, dead-letter exchange, and durability settings
3. WHEN I create a binding THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify routing key patterns and arguments
4. WHEN I delete a component THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation and remove all associated bindings
5. IF a component creation fails THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent submission

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to simulate consumers with configurable settings, so that I can test message processing scenarios without deploying actual consumer applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a virtual consumer THEN the system SHALL allow me to configure prefetch count, acknowledgment mode, and processing delay
2. WHEN a virtual consumer processes messages THEN the system SHALL display processing statistics including message count and error rates
3. WHEN I configure auto-acknowledgment THEN the system SHALL automatically acknowledge messages after processing
4. WHEN I configure manual acknowledgment THEN the system SHALL provide controls to acknowledge or reject messages
5. IF a virtual consumer encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor queue metrics and system performance through a dashboard, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time metrics for queue lengths, message rates, and consumer counts
2. WHEN metrics exceed configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL display alert notifications
3. WHEN I view historical data THEN the system SHALL provide charts showing metric trends over time
4. WHEN I configure alert thresholds THEN the system SHALL save the settings and apply them to future monitoring
5. IF metric collection fails THEN the system SHALL display a warning and continue with available data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want to manage dead-letter queues and retry failed messages, so that I can handle message processing failures effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are dead-lettered THEN the system SHALL route them to the configured dead-letter queue
2. WHEN I inspect dead-letter queue contents THEN the system SHALL display message details including original routing information and failure reason
3. WHEN I replay a dead-lettered message THEN the system SHALL republish the message to its original destination
4. WHEN I configure dead-letter settings THEN the system SHALL apply the configuration to the specified queue
5. IF dead-letter queue processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and maintain message integrity

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to secure the application with authentication and role-based access control, so that I can control who can view and modify the RabbitMQ configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL require authentication via OAuth2 or JWT
2. WHEN a user is assigned a view-only role THEN the system SHALL prevent access to modification functions
3. WHEN a user is assigned an operator role THEN the system SHALL allow message publishing and consumer management but prevent topology changes
4. WHEN a user is assigned an admin role THEN the system SHALL allow full access to all features
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page and display an error message

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export and import topology configurations, so that I can replicate setups across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I export a topology THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON/YAML file containing all exchanges, queues, bindings, and configuration settings
2. WHEN I import a topology configuration THEN the system SHALL create all specified components and display a summary of changes
3. WHEN import conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prompt for resolution options (skip, overwrite, or rename)
4. WHEN export/import operations complete THEN the system SHALL display a success message with operation details
5. IF export/import fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information and maintain system stability

------------------

This is an excellent and comprehensive requirements document for a RabbitMQ Service Management App! You've clearly thought through the user workflows and technical needs. Let me break down the key architectural considerations and implementation approach for this complex system.

Technical Architecture Overview
Frontend Stack:

React + TypeScript for the main application
React Flow for the interactive topology visualization
Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets
Chart.js/Recharts for monitoring dashboards
Tailwind CSS for responsive design
Key Technical Challenges:

1. Real-time Topology Visualization
React Flow will handle the interactive diagram with custom node types (producers, exchanges, queues, consumers)
Real-time message flow animations using React Flow's edge animations
Dynamic layout algorithms for auto-arranging complex topologies
Performance optimization for large topologies (50+ nodes)
2. Message Flow Animation System
Custom edge components with animated message "packets"
WebSocket/SSE integration for real-time message tracking
Visual state management for different message states (published, routed, consumed, dead-lettered)
3. Backend Integration
RabbitMQ Management API integration for topology management
Real-time message monitoring (likely requires custom RabbitMQ plugin or event streaming)
Virtual consumer simulation engine
Authentication/authorization layer
Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Core Topology Visualization

Basic React Flow setup with custom node types
RabbitMQ Management API integration
Static topology rendering
Phase 2: Real-time Features

Message flow animations
Live metric updates
SSE/WebSocket integration
Phase 3: Management Interface

CRUD operations for exchanges/queues/bindings
Message publishing interface
Virtual consumer simulation
Phase 4: Advanced Features

Monitoring dashboard
Dead-letter queue management
Import/export functionality
Authentication/RBAC
Key Questions
Backend Architecture: Do you plan to build a custom backend service, or integrate directly with RabbitMQ Management API from the frontend?

Real-time Message Tracking: How will you track individual messages for animation? This typically requires custom instrumentation.

Authentication Provider: Do you have a preference for OAuth2 provider (Auth0, Cognito, etc.) or would you prefer a custom JWT solution?

Deployment Environment: Will this run as a standalone web app, or integrate into existing infrastructure management tools?

Would you like me to start implementing any specific phase, or would you prefer to discuss the technical approach for any particular requirement in more detail?
